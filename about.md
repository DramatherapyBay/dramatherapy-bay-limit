# Meet Lily Lau
## HCPC Registered Arts Therapist (Dramatherapist)

Originally from Hong Kong, I am a British registered dramatherapist who uses drama and creativity to support emotional and psychological wellbeing. My approach combines evidence-based therapeutic techniques with the healing power of creative expression.

## My Specializations

- **Eeating disorders**
- **Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (C-PTSD)**

I'm passionate about community involvement and maintain an active lifestyle including:
- Taekwondo (I'm also a registered coach and referee!)
